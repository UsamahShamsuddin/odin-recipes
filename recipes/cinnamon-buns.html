            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 tbsp full fat milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For The Sugar Glaze</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>100g caster sugar</li>
            <li>100g water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by making the dough. Put the milk and eggs into the bowl of a food mixer then add the flour. Break in the yeast to one side of the bowl, then add the salt and sugar and butter to the other side.</li>
            <li>Mix on a slow speed for 4 minutes then increase the speed to medium and mix for a further 10-12 minutes until the dough comes away cleanly from the side of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Form the dough into a ball and pop into a clean floured bowl. Cover and leave for around 45 minutes or until double in size.</li>
            <li>Lightly flour a work surface and roll the dough into a rectangle roughly the size of an A3 sheet of paper.</li>
            <li>For the filling, beat the butter and sugar together until pale and stir in the cinnamon. Spread the filling over the top of the dough.</li>
            <li>With the long side facing you, fold in half lengthways to enclose the filling and slice it widthways into 24 strips each roughly 3.5cm across. Next, use a sharp knife to cut twice down the length of each strip to make three strands. Plait the three strands together and repeat to make 24 individual plaits.</li>
            <li>Take each plait and roll it up along its length to create a knot. Grease a 12 cup muffin tray and pop the knots into the tray. Cover and allow to prove for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Aim to have your Gozney oven at around 200Â°C with little to no flame. Brush the knots with the egg glaze and pop into the outdoor oven to bake for between 15-20 minutes until golden.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the sugar glaze. Put the sugar and water in a pan and bring to the boil, turn down to a simmer until you have a light syrup.</li>
            <li>Brush the baked knots with the syrup while still hot and leave to cool before devouring.</li>
        </ol>
